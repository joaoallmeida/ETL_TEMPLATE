# ETL Yts Movies üìΩÔ∏è
## Introducion üìë
This ETL is a sample of my coding work with python using *Apache Airflow* for pipeline orchestration, *Pandas* for data manipulation, *MySql* as storage and *Apache Superset* for data visualization.

This process uses the **YTS Movies API**, a public API for developers, as data sources.<br>
For more information about this API [click here](https://yts.torrentbay.to/api).
